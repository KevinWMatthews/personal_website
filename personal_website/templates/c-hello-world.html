        <h2>What is this blog all about?</h2>
        <p>This series of posts is about good practices in software development.</p>
        <p>It has examples of design patterns, testing strategies, language
          semantics, and third-party libraries. This is a collection of what I've
          had occasion to learn, so there is a bias toward embedded systems.</p>

        <p>The goal of each post is to actually "do" the thing in question, so
          code examples are part of example projects.</p>
        <p>These are available on GitHub.</p>
        <code>
<pre>
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  printf("Hello, World!\n");
  return 0;
}
</pre>
        </code>
        <p>Welcome and enjoy!</p>
